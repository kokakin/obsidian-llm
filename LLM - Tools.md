Many of these tools (the ones that run locally) require a GIT installation to work along with specific python versions and most times a CUDA enabled GPU (NVIDIA GPUs) (although it's possible to use alternatives sometimes, usually slower).

It is advised to set up virtual envs for each repository since they use different versions of common packages (you can only install one version of package on a simple system). On Linux it is highly advised to learn and use [[pyenv]], since it can provide directory based virtual envs automatically after setup. For each repo you should create a new virtualenv with the appropriate python version.

To start there are many tools, some online some offline and some hybrid;

[[Tools - Cloud]] - Cloud based tools;
[[Tools - Local]] - Local based tools;
[[Tools - Hybrid]] - Tools that somewhat lie in between the above;
