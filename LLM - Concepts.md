Here we explore some concepts that need to be understood in order to use LLMs effectively

- Concepts:
	- Parameters;
		- These are the main parts of the large language models. While generally having a rule to dictate what each parameter inside the model does, generally more parameters means a higher potential to be well adjusted for the task. Example with ifs.
	- Context size: 
		- assitant: 'um guarda de zoólogico'
		- user: 'um ser humano normal'
		- {user: ' meu nome é pedro, qual sua função'};
	- Token Input vs Token Output vs Token context;
	- Chat + Instruct
		- Special way to guide the LLM more precisely by adjusting it's context;
